## About
This project is a recreation of the Instagram interface, developed in React, which contains several features such as:

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Componentization of page elements for better code organization
- Listing of stories, posts and suggestions, using arrays and objects
- Editing username and profile picture via prompts
- Functionality to save and like posts
- I developed this project as a way to apply the knowledge acquired in React and improve my skills in front-end development.

I chose React because it is one of the main libraries for developing user interfaces, JavaScript as a programming language because of its popularity and versatility, and CSS for component styling.
